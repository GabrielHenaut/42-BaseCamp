# These are all the exercises I did for the [42 SP Basecamp](https://euquero.42sp.org.br/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwpcOTBhCZARIsAEAYLuWMRp4iSJgEcKv8aN3LSLZV4ndysgOvAmiTtIeaOVLAS6AWEqiJ5UIaArMlEALw_wcB).

The Basecamp is a 3-week-long immersion where you have to execute a series of exercises and have them correct by your peers. After that the exercises go through an auto tester which guaranties the correctness of the code. Besides that, all C code done has to go through the "Norminette", that test if the code has the proper formatting.

During the time of the camp I manage to do everything up to the list c_09, the rest of it I plan on doing just to get some more C practice (especially because most of the course is in C). Besides that, I do plan on going back and fixing the codes that were incorrect.

As soon as I have access to the intranet again, I'll post the original scores for each list.

This experience was the most intense and rewarding I've had, and I'm really excited to start actually doing the graduation.
